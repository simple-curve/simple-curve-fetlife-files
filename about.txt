Hello! I've been learning about and exploring kink since late 2023. I frequently attend munches, rope labs, and other kink events. I'm looking to meet more people in the community and continue learning. I'm always open to new friends and partners for practice and play. If we've met at an event, feel free to send me a friend request!

Regarding pronouns, I have been preferring they/them lately, but I accept all pronouns. Feel free to use any that feel appropriate based on the energy I'm giving off. See [this writing](https://fetlife.com/SimpleCurve/posts/12853970) for more details.

### Non-Kinky Stuff
My hobbies include listening to and playing music, learning new things, yoga, and exercise. I'm obsessive about my interests. In social settings, I range from being quiet and reserved to enthusiastically info dumping. I enjoy listening to people talk about their interests.

### Kinky Stuff
Rope is my primary interest. I started learning rope in late 2023 and, aside from taking a break in 2024, have been obsessed ever since. Once I start practicing, it's difficult to put the rope down. I enjoy rope partially for tactile reasons. It's soothing to run rope through my hands and fingers. Additionally, tying feels meditative in the way that it demands my focus. Tying seems to make me more in tune with my energy.

Beyond topping, I also self-tie. I find the immediate physical feedback informative for learning how to tie well. I have been self-suspending since summer 2025. This experience gave me the foundation to begin exploring partially and fully suspending others in late 2025.

Beyond rope, here are some of the things that I want to explore further:
- I seem to lean heavily towards being a top and a dom, although I want to gain more experience before labeling myself. I am open to bottoming and subbing, even if only for the additional experience, but these roles do not seem to resonate much with me.
- I've started exploring impact and very much enjoy it! I'm fascinated by whips and want to learn how to use them.
- I am a huge fan of makeup, and I have started to dabble in wearing makeup myself. I've even started to wear makeup to events! I love the idea of mixing dramatic makeup with masculine aesthetics. Some of my inspirations include Robert Welsh, Manny MUA, and Laila McQueen. I value developing skills through tutoring from experts, so *if you know of any makeup artists who offer lessons, particularly to masculine presenting people, please feel free to send me recommendations!*
- I love the aesthetic of BDSM. I am still in the process of finding my voice regarding the outfits and looks I want to wear to dungeons and events.
- I am interested in exploring energy, as defined by Jaiya. This interest began at an introductory BDSM class in which the teacher demonstrated a brief scene. I was inspired by her ability as a domme to move energy, and I aspire to learn these skills. Investigating this has led me to...
- Sacred sexuality and sex magick. This seems to lie at the intersection of my interests in yoga, kink, and energy. I'm currently reading Sacred Sex by Gabriela Herstik.
- I'm curious about tantra and hypno play. I like the meditative aspect of yoga, and these activities seem to have a similar meditative flavor.
- I'm curious about needle topping. My reaction to seeing images of needle play used to be 100% ick, but now it's like 30% ick and 70% fascination.

### Relationship Stuff
I am non-monogamous and partnered. I find that the self-reflection and open communication required for non-monogamy accelerates growth and development for both myself and for my relationships. One cannot be non-monogamous and complacent. I also have a strong sense of compersion. I've read most of Polywise and Polysecure.

### Sexuality
I am very much sexually attracted to femininity in general, and I considered myself heterosexual for most of my life, but I have begun to notice more diversity in the people I find attractive, and I am interested in exploring my attraction towards all gender identities and expressions.
